# biotechnology course 🌱

Hello everybody!
Here you can find some of the projects developed in the biotechnology course (although in my opinion it should have been called bioinfomatics haha 🤓) during my third year of biomedical engineering studies. 
We mainly learnt about the use of R and the tools it can offer as well as we extended our knowledge in 📊 statistical analysis (multinomial model, parameter estimation), biological information 🧬(Open Reading Frames), sequence alignment methods, multiple alignments, Markov chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) 👩🏼‍💻
